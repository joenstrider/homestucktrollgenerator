# homestucktrollgenerator
a generator for homestuck trolls.

the point of this project is to create a generator for homestuck fantrolls. 
currently it can generate:

- a (full) name
- blood colour
- a nickname
- a trollian handle
- a classpect
- a land
- a dream planet
- a like and a dislikes
- quadrants
- best friend + rival


currently, i am missing a great deal of names, land titles, and trollhandles in the dictionary, but i can't do much about that at the moment.


below are instructions for editing the code.

to add aspects or classes, go to variable a or variable c.
to add names, go to miscfirst/misclast.
to add the first segment of a handle, go to fftrollian. to add the second, go to fstrollian.
to add more blood colors, go to bloodcolor. if they're mutant colors, add them into mutantcolor.
